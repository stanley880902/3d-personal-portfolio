# 3D Portfolio Website

This is a professional portfolio project that showcases my skills in creating visually stunning websites using modern web development technologies. 
The project is built using **React, Framer Motion, SCSS, Tailwind, and Three.js**.

It features an array of animations and 3D models that will captivate and engage visitors to the site.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in creating this project:

- Three.js - A powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating 3D models.
- React Three Fiber - A popular library for creating 3D graphics with Three.js in React.
- TailwindCSS - A popular utility-first CSS styling framework that allows for efficient and consistent styling.
- Framer Motion - A highly popular library used to bring React websites to life with animations.


## In this portfolio project, I learned how to:

- Load, create and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights. 
-  Gain an understanding of the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space, all made possible by utilizing the Three.js and React Three Fiber libraries.
-  Make my code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices.
-  Implement sending emails through a form on the website using React components and state management.
-  Ensure responsiveness across all devices and improved site performance using Suspense and Preload features. This ensured fast load times and a smooth user experience.
